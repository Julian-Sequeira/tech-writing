# Project Amber

Project Amber is an remote attestation service, launched by Intel but purportedly operating *outside* of Intel as an independent trust authority. Let's explore how this might work.

## Vision 2022 Press Release

I'll summarize the contents of this link here: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/vision-2022-project-amber-security.html

Project Amber is the first step in creating a multi-cloud TEE environment, for third party attestation. It is/can:
- cloud agnostic, working within private and hybrid cloud environments
- support confidential computing workloads running on bare metal containers, VMs, or containers
- operate independent of the infrastructure provider hosting the confidential compute workloads

... that's it I suppose, the details on project Amber are pretty light, and I'll have to update this page when I get more information
